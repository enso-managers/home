## Sheet → ReqIF

<p>Transform a spreadsheet to the Requirements Interchange Format (ReqIF). The property names are expected in the first line (column head) and an entity (<span class="text-bg-light"><em>SPEC-OBJECT</em></span> in ReqIF terms) with its property values per following line.</p><p>The property names are semantically interpreted and translated using the SpecIF Ontology. For example, a property name <span class="text-bg-light"><em>Title</em></span> is first normalized to <span class="text-bg-light"><em>dcterms:title</em></span> and then mapped to <span class="text-bg-light"><em>ReqIF.Name</em></span>.</p><p>For details, please refer to the <a href="./manual-sheet2reqif.html" target="_blank">Manual Sheet → ReqIF</a></p>
